## Inline Six Engine CAD Model

This project was influenced by my hobby of mechanics. From a young age, I have worked on cars and motorcycles with my father, a former mechanic. The purpose of this model was to teach myself computer-aided design, and familiarize myself with Solidworks. This engine was inspired by a popular inline six JDM engine. The scope of this project was for drafting experience only, and thus the dimensions and materials were not chosen as to design a realistic engine. I did not have physical access to this engine, so dimensions were acquired from shop manuals and online forums when available. Important and public specifications of this engine are accurate. Other measurements were derived from these dimensions, or estimated through scaling images and comparing them to known measurements within the image, which provided high enough accuracy for the scope of this design. All components were modeled by me using Solidworks; I decided not to use the toolbox as an added challenge. Prior to this project, I had gone through the Solidworks tutorials. I then modeled this engine to solidify what I had learned, apply the techniques I had studied in realistic applications, and to continue learning more advanced CAD techniques.

This project is ongoing and I will upload images as I feel components are ready to be displayed. Working gifs will be added once I am happy with the full assembly.
